"""Task 1: Leap Year Checker
Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a year. The program should determine if the given year is a leap year or not and then display an appropriate message. Please note that this is the definition of a leap year: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.

Expected Outcome: If you test the year 1900, is should be False. The year 2000 should be True. The year 2024 should be True"""

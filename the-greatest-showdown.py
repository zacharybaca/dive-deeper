"""Task 1: Identify the Greatest
Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter three numbers. The program should then identify and print out the largest number among the three."""

"""Task 2: Identify the Smallest
Extend your program from Task 1 to also determine the smallest number among the three and print it out."""

"""Task 3: Equality Check
Enhance your program to handle cases where two or all of the numbers are equal. The program should display appropriate messages like "Two numbers are equal and the largest" or "All numbers are equal"."""


"""Expected Outcome: If we provide the numbers 3, 3, and 4, it should print out that "The smallest number is 3. The largest number is 4. There are two numbers equal to each other." Printing out which numbers are equal would be a great added bonus."""
